# Understanding JavaScript Closures

JavaScript closures are a fundamental concept in the language, allowing functions to retain access to their **lexical scope** even when executed outside that scope. This feature is particularly useful for creating **private variables** and encapsulating functionality, which can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.

## What is a Closure?

A **closure** is created when a function retains access to its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope. In simpler terms, a closure gives you the ability to remember the environment in which a function was created.

### Simple Example of a Closure

Here's a straightforward example to illustrate closures:

```javascript
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0; // Private variable
  return function () {
    count++; // Increment the count
    return count; // Return the current count
  };
}

const counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```
